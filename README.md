# Train a Smartcab to Drive

Part of the [**Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.**](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t)

Applied reinforcement learning to build a simulated vehicle navigation agent. This project involved modeling a complex control problem in terms of limited available inputs, and designing a scheme to automatically learn an optimal driving strategy based on rewards and penalties.
